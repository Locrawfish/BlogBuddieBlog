Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! 

My name is Loren, and I'm a junior Rails developer.

You may be asking yourself: what the heck is a Gl√ºhbirnen? Well, it's the German word for lightbulbs. And with this blog, I hope to shine a light (ha!) on my experiences, struggles, and wins as a junior dev. Hope you enjoy my lightbulbs! :) 

You can find out what I'm working on:
